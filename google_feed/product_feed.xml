ABOUT THE BRAND:
Nestled in the ‘Crystal Valley’ mountain region of the Czech Republic, the kilns of KLIMCHI studios have been used by glass artisans to sculpt bohemian crystal since 1905. It was then 2019 when entrepreneur Lukas Klimcak brought new life to the workshops. Inspired by the dramatic landscape of the region, Lukas and his new team now bring an exciting and youthful vision to his family’s tradition of handmade glass production.Since 2020, KLIMCHI has fast become known across the globe for its exclusive and dynamic collections, initially created under the guidance of Czech glass designer Frantisek Jungvirt. A renowned artist, Frantisek has helped rediscover and popularise techniques that have been forgotten, inspiring a new generation of art lovers and designers. Thus, the ancient art of glass blowing and historical decors tell a new story of the young KLIMCHI brand with minimalist modern design and dynamic pigments.</rich_description><link>https://joyandco.com/product/bronze-hobnail-jug-tall-MItwRN</link><image_link>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf3a6be2307.webp</image_link><additional_image_link>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf4d60a0d44.webp</additional_image_link><availability>in stock</availability><price>475.00 AED</price><brand>KLIMCHI</brand><condition>new</condition><category>Products</category><google_product_category>3330</google_product_category><mpn>bronze-hobnail-jug-tall-MItwRN</mpn><gtin /><additional_images><image>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf4d60a0d44.webp</image></additional_images></product><product><id>bronze-hobnail-tumblers-set-of-6-gLiGbn</id><title>Set of 6 Bronze Hobnail Tumblers</title><description>Shall you desire to add warm accents to your dining environment, a set of handmade bobble glasses in reddish hues would be a perfect choice!

ABOUT THE BRAND:
Nestled in the ‘Crystal Valley’ mountain region of the Czech Republic, the kilns of KLIMCHI studios have been used by glass artisans to sculpt bohemian crystal since 1905. It was then 2019 when entrepreneur Lukas Klimcak brought new life to the workshops. Inspired by the dramatic landscape of the region, Lukas and his new team now bring an exciting and youthful vision to his family’s tradition of handmade glass production.Since 2020, KLIMCHI has fast become known across the globe for its exclusive and dynamic collections, initially created under the guidance of Czech glass designer Frantisek Jungvirt. A renowned artist, Frantisek has helped rediscover and popularise techniques that have been forgotten, inspiring a new generation of art lovers and designers. Thus, the ancient art of glass blowing and historical decors tell a new story of the young KLIMCHI brand with minimalist modern design and dynamic pigments.</rich_description><link>https://joyandco.com/product/crystal-hobnail-jug-with-gold-handle-U5RN5L</link><image_link>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf3b3d5770c.webp</image_link><additional_image_link>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf3b403749b.webp</additional_image_link><availability>in stock</availability><price>750.00 AED</price><brand>KLIMCHI</brand><condition>new</condition><category>Products</category><google_product_category>674</google_product_category><mpn>crystal-hobnail-jug-with-gold-handle-U5RN5L</mpn><gtin /><additional_images><image>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf3b403749b.webp</image></additional_images></product><product><id>crystal-hobnail-tumblers-set-of-6-zEUa32</id><title>Set of 6 Crystal Hobnail Tumblers</title><description>Be different from the crowd and take a unique twist on a timeless classic.

ABOUT THE BRAND:
Nestled in the ‘Crystal Valley’ mountain region of the Czech Republic, the kilns of KLIMCHI studios have been used by glass artisans to sculpt bohemian crystal since 1905. It was then 2019 when entrepreneur Lukas Klimcak brought new life to the workshops. Inspired by the dramatic landscape of the region, Lukas and his new team now bring an exciting and youthful vision to his family’s tradition of handmade glass production.Since 2020, KLIMCHI has fast become known across the globe for its exclusive and dynamic collections, initially created under the guidance of Czech glass designer Frantisek Jungvirt. A renowned artist, Frantisek has helped rediscover and popularise techniques that have been forgotten, inspiring a new generation of art lovers and designers. Thus, the ancient art of glass blowing and historical decors tell a new story of the young KLIMCHI brand with minimalist modern design and dynamic pigments.</rich_description><link>https://joyandco.com/product/neon-citrine-hobnail-jug-PmY5xi</link><image_link>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf3b9a2c7dd.webp</image_link><additional_image_link>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf4c16631c5.webp</additional_image_link><availability>in stock</availability><price>600.00 AED</price><brand>KLIMCHI</brand><condition>new</condition><category>Products</category><google_product_category>3330</google_product_category><mpn>neon-citrine-hobnail-jug-PmY5xi</mpn><gtin /><additional_images><image>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf4c16631c5.webp</image></additional_images></product><product><id>neon-citrine-hobnail-tumblers-set-of-6-3uVHor</id><title>Set of 6 Neon Citrine Hobnail Tumblers</title><description>Be different from the crowd and take a unique twist on a timeless classic.

ABOUT THE BRAND:
Nestled in the ‘Crystal Valley’ mountain region of the Czech Republic, the kilns of KLIMCHI studios have been used by glass artisans to sculpt bohemian crystal since 1905. It was then 2019 when entrepreneur Lukas Klimcak brought new life to the workshops. Inspired by the dramatic landscape of the region, Lukas and his new team now bring an exciting and youthful vision to his family’s tradition of handmade glass production.Since 2020, KLIMCHI has fast become known across the globe for its exclusive and dynamic collections, initially created under the guidance of Czech glass designer Frantisek Jungvirt. A renowned artist, Frantisek has helped rediscover and popularise techniques that have been forgotten, inspiring a new generation of art lovers and designers. Thus, the ancient art of glass blowing and historical decors tell a new story of the young KLIMCHI brand with minimalist modern design and dynamic pigments.</rich_description><link>https://joyandco.com/product/neon-citrine-hobnail-tumblers-set-of-6-3uVHor</link><image_link>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf3937d0c69.webp</image_link><additional_image_link>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf48d31abb3.webp</additional_image_link><availability>in stock</availability><price>680.00 AED</price><brand>KLIMCHI</brand><condition>new</condition><category>Products</category><google_product_category>2951</google_product_category><mpn>neon-citrine-hobnail-tumblers-set-of-6-3uVHor</mpn><gtin /><additional_images><image>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf48d31abb3.webp</image><image>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf48d4705c0.webp</image><image>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf48d5dd763.webp</image></additional_images></product><product><id>nora-candle-holder-vqp6ua</id><title>Nora Pink Candle Holder</title><description>The Nora Candle Holder, featuring a layered sphere silhouette and vibrant color options in citrus green, purple, and blush pink glass, brings a modern and stylish touch to any space.Material: GlassDimensions: 8x8x26.5 cm</description><rich_description>The Nora Candle Holder, featuring a layered sphere silhouette and vibrant color options in citrus green, purple, and blush pink glass, brings a modern and stylish touch to any space.Material: GlassDimensions: 8x8x26.5 cm
