ABOUT THE BRAND:
Nestled in the ‘Crystal Valley’ mountain region of the Czech Republic, the kilns of KLIMCHI studios have been used by glass artisans to sculpt bohemian crystal since 1905. It was then 2019 when entrepreneur Lukas Klimcak brought new life to the workshops. Inspired by the dramatic landscape of the region, Lukas and his new team now bring an exciting and youthful vision to his family’s tradition of handmade glass production.Since 2020, KLIMCHI has fast become known across the globe for its exclusive and dynamic collections, initially created under the guidance of Czech glass designer Frantisek Jungvirt. A renowned artist, Frantisek has helped rediscover and popularise techniques that have been forgotten, inspiring a new generation of art lovers and designers. Thus, the ancient art of glass blowing and historical decors tell a new story of the young KLIMCHI brand with minimalist modern design and dynamic pigments.</rich_description><link>https://joyandco.com/product/crystal-hobnail-jug-with-gold-handle-U5RN5L</link><image_link>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/meta/def.webp</image_link><additional_image_link>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf3b3d5770c.webp</additional_image_link><availability>in stock</availability><price>750.00 AED</price><brand>KLIMCHI</brand><condition>new</condition><category>Products</category><google_product_category>635</google_product_category><mpn>crystal-hobnail-jug-with-gold-handle-U5RN5L</mpn><gtin /><additional_images><image>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf3b3d5770c.webp</image><image>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf3b403749b.webp</image></additional_images></product><product><id>firelight-duo-vase-b58wuT</id><title>Firelight Duo Vase</title><description>Turn up the drama with the Firelight Duo Vase, a bold statement in two rich tones of red glass.

ABOUT THE BRAND:
Nestled in the ‘Crystal Valley’ mountain region of the Czech Republic, the kilns of KLIMCHI studios have been used by glass artisans to sculpt bohemian crystal since 1905. It was then 2019 when entrepreneur Lukas Klimcak brought new life to the workshops. Inspired by the dramatic landscape of the region, Lukas and his new team now bring an exciting and youthful vision to his family’s tradition of handmade glass production.Since 2020, KLIMCHI has fast become known across the globe for its exclusive and dynamic collections, initially created under the guidance of Czech glass designer Frantisek Jungvirt. A renowned artist, Frantisek has helped rediscover and popularise techniques that have been forgotten, inspiring a new generation of art lovers and designers. Thus, the ancient art of glass blowing and historical decors tell a new story of the young KLIMCHI brand with minimalist modern design and dynamic pigments.</rich_description><link>https://joyandco.com/product/neon-citrine-hobnail-tumblers-set-of-6-3uVHor</link><image_link>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/meta/def.webp</image_link><additional_image_link>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf3937d0c69.webp</additional_image_link><availability>in stock</availability><price>680.00 AED</price><brand>KLIMCHI</brand><condition>new</condition><category>Products</category><google_product_category>635</google_product_category><mpn>neon-citrine-hobnail-tumblers-set-of-6-3uVHor</mpn><gtin /><additional_images><image>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf3937d0c69.webp</image><image>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf48d31abb3.webp</image><image>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf48d4705c0.webp</image><image>https://joyandco.com/storage/app/public/product/2025-02-26-67bf48d5dd763.webp</image></additional_images></product><product><id>pegasus-breakfast-plate-rOnjMj</id><title>Pegasus Breakfast Plate</title><description>The Pegasus Breakfast Plate has a stunningly creative design that will remind you of life’s magic in the small things.
